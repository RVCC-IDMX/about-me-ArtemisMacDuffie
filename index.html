                <h2>
                    CSS animation: what, why, and how
                </h2>

                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p>Animation is essentially the act of causing something to move or change, especially graphics of some kind. It is easy to consider it entertainment, but designers must consider the effect it has from both an aesthetic and functional perspective. As addressed by Vanessa Alvarez in her presentation for Women Who Code, animation is attention-grabbing, which can be beneficial or deleterious. It can be distracting or malicious, but there are many benefits when used responsibly. It can be used to convey concepts more fluently than words or images alone, such as expressing brand identity, emotional messaging, or demonstration. In addition to being a vehicle for ideas, there are practical uses, such as helping users visualize information flow, helping users understand relationships between elements, giving users feedback to input, and informing users of app state.</p>

                    <p>Animations can be placed in web pages as embedded media, such as videos (or the once common flash media), and they can be created with Javascript. However, CSS alone gives powerful tools for animation that does not require external media or complex code. One implementation is through the animation properties, which include the name of the keyframe rule that defines the animation, as well as various animation parameters such as duration, delay, and form of iteration. For example, this button below, designed by Yuhomyan, features a keyframe rule involving opacity and color such that it appears as a glint flashing over the button. The animation properties are in the declaration block for the button’s before pseudoclass such that it iterates forever with a three-second delay in between occurrences.</p>

                    <div id="hover-effect">
                        <button class="custom-btn btn-11">Read More<div class="dot"></div></button>
                    </div>

                    <p>Another form of animation includes use of pseudoclasses to trigger a change in an element, particularly hover, though others are useful as well, such as checked. This button features animations based on pseudoclasses as well; on hover, it slightly changes color, and on active, its shadows change such that it gives the impression of being pushed, both of which help give user feedback. Another example is the hamburger menu icon that appears on this page’s navbar when the screen is at narrower sizes. On hover, the color shifts from dark blue to pink, and clicking it activates a hidden checkbox, which in turn rotates the icon and animates the menu as a dropdown. Instead of animation properties, these sorts of animations are generally defined by transition properties in CSS.</p>

                    <p>Some CSS animations use Sass or other style sheet languages to create animations that are technically possible in raw CSS but would be overly complex or difficult to write. For example, SCSS was used by sarazond to create an animation of a starfield moving in parallax, shown below this paragraph. The uncompiled code is very readable, with a Sass function that produces a white shadow and a few calls that iterates the function hundreds of times. Compiled into normal CSS, the function creates these many shadows which would be difficult and tedious to write manually.</p>

                    <div id="parallax">
                        <!--cool codepen I found that uses
                            functions and keyframe to create
                            a starfield that perpetually moves
                            with the illusion of parallax -->
                        <div id="starbox">
                            <div id='stars'></div>
                            <div id='stars2'></div>
                            <div id='stars3'></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>It is worth noting that the examples so far have not required any external media, only HTML elements and CSS styling. Although external media could be incorporated, such as applying a blur effect to an image, the versatility of CSS animation without them is noteworthy. The stars are white shadows, the hamburger icon is a linear gradient, and the button is simply a button. Because HTML can be used to create SVGs, CSS animation can use a wide variety of more complex shapes as well. Below are two examples of loaders, the first of which only uses simple HTML elements, while the second uses a series of SVGs to animate more modular and sophisticated images. As written by Stephen Delaney, they are simply circles, but by changing the SVG code in the HTML document, they could be squares, stars, or any other variety of shapes, and of any color (or series of colors) that can be described by RGB notation.</p>

                    <p>There is the question of why a developer should use CSS instead of Javascript for these purposes. Ritesh Gupta was given an animation requirement as part of a project and needed to decide which would be better for the animation described. In his blog post on the topic, he described the advantages to each. In brief, Javascript grants much more granular control over animation, but CSS animations are more stable and optimized. Javascript performance is variable and can be much better than CSS, but it could also be worse. For his animation, he decided to use CSS because it would be easier for a wide variety of devices to run, and the effects being animated were straightforward to implement in CSS. Below is an example of the animation properties being applied to my site logo, iterating infinitely.</p>

                    <div id="slide">
                        <img src="img/am-orbital.png" width="240" alt="The letters A and M">
                    </div>

                    <p>To summarize, animations have many uses, both as a form of artistic expression and a tool of functional design. Real-time animation in browsers can be done through CSS and Javascript, but CSS offers advantages in elegance, stability, and optimization. Implementing CSS animation is more or less a matter of deciding which CSS properties are to be changed, how they should change, and how the animation is triggered. It is easy to be excessive with animations, but their utility and potential mean that developers should be fully aware of how to create and use them.</p>
